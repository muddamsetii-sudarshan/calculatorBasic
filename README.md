# calculatorBasic
A small basic calculator project
#used HTML, CSS, and javascript
In this project, I have used flex-box of CSS for creating the front end.
And used event triggers in javascript to add the functionality of the calculator website.
if C is clicked in the calculator it will reset the input value to empty.
